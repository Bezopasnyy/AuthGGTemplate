This is just a basic AuthGG Template
Written in python
It also has a discord webhook system wheere when a client registers or logins in, it will send it to a message or embed to your discord channel.
Make sure to replace API KEY ETC and change username to the username of your webhook bot
Also it will only work on windows unless you remove the if os == "Windows"
